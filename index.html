        <div class="about">
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Technology at AMU. I have a passion for creating projects using front-end technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in North Dakota. I'm a family person with a loving wife and two amazing kids. I'm open to working remotely, offering flexibility in collaboration without sacrificing productivity. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me hitting the gym, exploring the great outdoors through hiking, cheering on my favorite football team, or embarking on exciting adventures with my family.</p>
            <p>From my time in the military, you will notice I bring a genuine willingness to learn and a strong work ethic to the table, eager to immerse myself in new challenges and contribute to the success of any team I join. Let's connect and bring digital dreams to life together!</p>
