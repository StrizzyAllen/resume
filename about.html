            <h1>Get to know me</h1>
            <p>I am a full time student at American Military University online and computer support/IT Asset manager serving in the MN National Guard. Despite my demanding schedule, I've grown a deep passion for web development and dedicating myself to learning various languages and frameworks in recent years. Beyond my academic and military commitments, I invest considerable time sharpening my skills, crafting projects, and learning everything I can to prepare for a future in web development.</p>
            <p>As an infantryman serving in the U.S. Army, I've been accustomed to an environment that demands leadership, adaptability, and unwavering dedication. These qualities are my main approach to web development and have given me the ability to pursue this career field. With a blend of military discipline and a passion to learn, I am committed to delivering quality work and growing with you. Let's build something remarkable.</p>
            <p>Feel free to connect with me via email or LinkedIn to discuss opportunities or collaborations. For collaborative ventures, reach out to me on GitHub, and let's embark on an exciting journey of creation together.</p>
